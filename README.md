**‚ÜôÔ∏è ER diagrams ‚ÜòÔ∏è simple üëå powerful üí™**

**erd.lol** is an intuitive web interface for creating Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams. It bridges the gap for those who want to produce ER diagrams, but don't want to learn Mermaid. It's an ideal tool for beginners, students, and professionals who are short on time but require effective diagramming solutions.

### Potential Downsides

Mermaid can struggle with making legible ER diagrams when the number of tables and relationships is high. This is arbitrary (what's "high") and subjective (what's "legible"). But keep in mind that using Mermaid's layout algorithm comes with the drawback that you cannot manually arrange entities.
