**↙️ ER diagrams ↘️ simple 👌 powerful 💪**

**erd.lol** is an intuitive web interface for creating Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams. It bridges the gap for those who want to produce ER diagrams, but don't want to learn Mermaid. It's an ideal tool for beginners, students, and professionals who are short on time but require effective diagramming solutions.

### Feature Roadmap

- [x] **Reactive form**: Dead-simple editor built to support any reasonable number of tables, columns, and relationships. (March 9th, 2024)
- [x] **Preview**: Every keystroke updates the Mermaid live preview. (March 9th, 2024)
- [x] **Save to browser**: Auto-save one diagram with in-browser storage.
- [ ] **Color and formatting**: Enable style editing.

- [ ] **Export**: Export your diagrams to PNG and PDF for presentations and documents.
- [ ] **Account**: Create the concept of an account.
- [ ] **Save to account**: Persist diagrams within an account.


### Potential Downsides

Mermaid can struggle with making palatable ER diagrams when the number of tables and relationships is high. This is arbitrary (what's "high") and subjective (what's "palatable"). But keep in mind that using Mermaid's layout algorithm comes with the drawback that you cannot manually arrange entities.
